The producers have stated that as the first season is about introducing the survivors and the second season is about the hatch, the third season is about the Others, a group of mysterious island inhabitants.\n\nIn response to fan complaints about scheduling in the previous seasons, ABC decided to air the episodes without reruns, albeit in two separate blocks. In the United States, the first block consisted of six episodes aired on Wednesdays at 9:00 pm and after a twelve week break, the season continued with the remaining 16 episodes at 10:00 pm. In addition, three clip-shows recapped previous events on the show. \"Lost: A Tale of Survival\" aired a week before the season premiere, \"Lost Survivor Guide\" aired before the seventh episode and \"Lost: The Answers\" aired before the season finale Buena Vista Home Entertainment released the season under the title Lost: The Complete Third Season – The Unexplored Experience on December 11, 2007 in Region 1 on DVD and Blu-ray Disc.', 'lost-4607_3.jpg', 14043, '2020-11-27 11:54:15', NULL),

The season continues the stories of a group of over 40 people who have been stranded on a remote island in the South Pacific, after their airplane crashed there more than 90 days prior to the beginning of the season. According to Lost\'s executive producers/writers/showrunners Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse, there are two main themes in fourth season: \"the castaways\' relationship to the freighter folk\" and \"who gets off the island and the fact that they need to get back\". Lost came under scrutiny from critics in its third season, but the fourth season was acclaimed for its flash-forwards, pace and new characters.\n\nThe season was originally planned to contain 16 episodes; eight were filmed before the start of the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike. Following the strike\'s resolution, it was announced that only five more episodes would be produced to complete the season; however, the season finale\'s script was so long that network executives approved the production of a 14th episode as part of a three-hour season finale split over two nights. The fourth season aired Tuesdays at 9:00 pm from January 31 to March 20, 2008 and at 10:00 pm from April 24 to May 15, 2008. The two-hour finale aired at 9:00 pm on May 29, 2008. Buena Vista Home Entertainment released the season on DVD and Blu-ray Disc under the title Lost: The Complete Fourth Season – The Expanded Experience on December 9, 2008 in Region 1; however, it was released earlier—on October 20, 2008—in Region 2.', 'lost-4607_4.jpg', 14044, '2020-11-27 11:54:15', NULL),

(1127, 268, 4, '2017-10-13', 'It’s been quite a year (or three) for Jane Villanueva. She got married and then, at long last… Jane had sex. That’s right, friends, she’s Jane the Virgin no more! And let me tell you, married life was everything she had hoped for… until the worst thing ever happened and Michael died. I know. It was a heartbreaker. We pick our story up three years later and Jane’s life is certainly not what she planned. First of all, she’s a widow, like her Abuela. But she’s also channeled that grief into a book about her love story with Michael… And guess what? It was being published! Oh, and also on the bright side – Jane’s parents finally found their way back to each other and got engaged. And speaking of finding their way back to each other, Jane and Rafael are now the closest of friends. And it’s a good thing, because remember their cute, snuggly son Mateo? Well, he’s now quite the handful – to put it mildly. And to make matters worse – Rafael’s twins he had with Petra were frickin’ angels. Oh, and Petra was kicking butt professionally too. Business was booming at the Marbella until everyone’s (not) favorite employee Scott was found dead! I know, OMG, right? And soon, Petra and her twin sister Anezka were both suspects! But you know who it actually was… ? Actually, I’m not going to spoil it, but trust me – it was straight out of a telenovela...', 'jane-the-virgin-61418_4.jpg', 91747, '2020-11-27 11:55:26', NULL),
